    <h1>css</h1>
    <p class="text1">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
         This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification 
         of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS 
         in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .
         css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

    </p>
   <p class="text2">Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for 
    different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and 
    on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
     device.
