Listen, equality before the law in America does not exist. And that’s what we are going to talk about today with our guest, Dyjuan Tatro.

Dyjuan, thank you for joining us today on Rattling the Bars. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions against one individual and four entities tied to the brutal Russian paramilitary Wagner Group and its leader Yevgeniy Prigozhin. Under OFAC’s list of Specially Designated Nationals, the sanctions target Nikolayevich Andrey Ivanov and the entities Diamville Sau, Industrial Resources General Trading, Limited Liability Company DM, and Midas Ressources Sarlu. A new Africa Gold advisory was also released, focusing on the gold sector in sub-Saharan Africa.
        Charles Cater, Director of Investigations at The Sentry, said: “As the Wagner Group uses extreme violence to control the exploitation of natural resources in war-torn and weak states, the sanctions imposed today on Diamville, Midas Ressources, and associated enablers are critically important to disrupting its financing.  For maximum impact, the middlemen that have facilitated Wagner Group operations should also be targeted, particularly political and military elites complicit in widespread human rights violations by the mercenary firm in the Central African Republic and elsewhere.”</P>

     <div class="para"><h1>WHO EXACTLY IS ‘FORCING’ AMERICA TO SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES?</h1>Mr. Biden has concluded, much as his predecessors did, that he needs India despite concerns over human rights just as he believes he needs Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and other countries that are either outright autocracies or do not fit into the category of ideal democracies. At a time of confrontation with Russia and an uneasy standoff with China, Mr. Biden is being forced to accept the flaws of America’s friends.
        That the US would back a country because it is autocratic, as opposed to backing a country despite this fact, never crosses Baker and Mashal’s minds. It’s simply taken for granted that US officials’ default position is identical to that of a scrappy,For being such a noble empire, the US is “forced” into such moral compromises quite frequently. Last summer, for instance,  when Biden rolled out the red carpet for Saudi dictator and journalist-slayer Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, we were told repeatedly that he was, again, “forced” into doing so (emphases mine):
        those managing US empire need a story to tell themselves. The 2.86 million people who work at the Pentagon, the 45,000 who work for the State Department, the 22,000 who work for the CIA—all of them need to go home every night and generally feel good about what they do. They cannot function in their professional capacity—indeed, no one can—without a broad belief that the work they do is done for the benefit of humanity. The same is true of their counterparts in countries like Russia, Iran, and China. The same is true of the 72,000 employees of Exxon who need to believe what they do is good, and that they are indeed a part of the climate change “solution.” Trump was already indicted by a Manhattan grand jury and is facing 34 felony charges in New York for alleged crimes committed during his 2016 presidential campaign. Now, Trump is also facing federal indictments for 37 felony counts related to mishandling classified documents, obstructing justice, and making false statements. All the while, Trump is campaigning for his 2024 election run. He’s fundraising, he’s enjoying his freedom, and he’s running his mouth on every media outlet that will give him a platform. At the same time, the majority of people being held captive in the notorious Rikers Island jail in New York, have had their freedom taken away, even though they haven’t been convicted of any crime.
        In the worlds of war and work, hardly anyone wakes up feeling like they’re the bad guy.

With Rattling the Bars, by presenting hard data and real-life stories, we examine and seek to shift public opinion around the misconception that incarceration, punishment, and increased policing make cities safer—the truth of which has been disproven by countless studies. The series examines the history and root causes of the current so-called justice system. It showcases individuals and communities nationwide who are grappling with real solutions to problems created by the prison-industrial complex.

In the modern world, supposedly no one is above the rule of law, not CEOs of wealthy corporations, not even current and former presidents. But of course, here in America, US, the realities of our so-called “criminal injustice system” are constantly reminding us that equality before the law is a dream that only exists on paper, not in practice. Look at what’s happening right now with the indictment of billionaire, former president Donald Trump, and compare that to the nightmare that poor Black and Brown people are living through every day in Rikers Island in New York. of our reporting on the fight to end it.

    <div class="para"><h1>SAME RED SCARE PROPAGANDA AND LIES</h1>China’s influence activities have moved beyond their My name is Maximilian Alvarez. I’m the editor-in-chief at the Real News Network where Bill is one of our new board members and it has been an honor to get to work with Bill in my capacity as editor-in-chief at the Real News Network. But… you’re a fascinating guy, Bill. I feel like because I knew about you before we ever met, obviously since season 1 of doing my show Working People where I interview workers and we talk about their lives, their jobs, the labor movement. From season 1, people were like, “Oh, you should talk to this guy, Bill Fletcher Jr.” And they kept asking me about it and then eventually I had to have you on the show. And it’s like, I mean the bio on the back of your book reads, quote, “Bill Fetcher Jr. Is the author of Their Bankrupting Us from Beacon Press 2012. He is a longtime racial justice, labor and international activist traditional All right, well welcome everyone to the great Red Emma’s Cooperative Bookstore and Cafe here in Baltimore. It is so great to see all of you, and it is such an honor to be here with our guests for tonight, Bill Fletcher Jr. We are of course, here to talk about and celebrate the publication of Bill’s second novel length work of fiction entitled The Man Who Changed Colors. And of course, we’re not going to be able to do full justice to this book in the next 45, 50 minutes. So I want to just be upfront with everyone that our goal is to get you interested, and to go buy the book and read it yourself. So if you’re open, we’re going to give you a full SparkNotes synopsis. I’m letting you know now, we’re going to disappoint you, but there’s so much rich stuff here to  United Front focus on diaspora communities to target a far broader range of sectors in Western societies, ranging from think tanks, universities, and media to state, local, and national government institutions. China seeks to promote views sympathetic to the Chinese Government [sic], policies, society, and culture; suppress alternative views; and co-opt key American players to support China’s foreign policy goals and economic interests … Except for Russia, no other country’s efforts to influence American politics and society is as extensive and well-funded as China’s. On its face, FARA is startlingly broad: it applies equally to “agents” of a foreign government — like Saudi Arabia — or of a foreign person or entity — such as a Japanese company like Toyota, a nonprofit based abroad like Amnesty International, or a foreign-based media organization such as The Guardian.  Covered activity under the Act includes attempts to influence U.S. public opinion on any foreign or domestic policy issue; soliciting or disbursing anything of value; or disseminating oral, visual, or written information of any kind for or in the interest of a foreign principal.  Unlike a traditional principal–agent relationship, an agency relationship under the Act does not require “direction” or “control” by the principal over the agent, or even the consent of either party. Instead, it can be created if someone in the United States acts at the mere “request” of a foreign principal.  For example, if a nonprofit in Chicago sets up a public meeting at the “request” of a Canadian nonprofit partner to discuss the best way to fight the opioid epidemic, the Chicago nonprofit would arguably need to register as a “foreign agent”: in setting the public meeting, the Chicago nonprofit would be attempting to influence U.S. public opinion on a domestic policy issue at the “request” of a foreign principal — the Canadian nonprofit.
